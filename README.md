# Remult-Angular-Todo

This project is based on the remult tutorial  [Todo App with Angular
](https://remult.github.io/guide/setup-angular.html) and saves all the work of doing the step by step setup.

Simply open a command line and run the following commands to setup:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/remult/remult-angular-todo.git
cd remult-angular-todo
npm i
```

Once it's done, open two terminals to run:
1. The api server
   ```
   npm run dev-node
   ```
2. The Angular dev cli
   ``` 
   npm run dev-ng
   ```

And proceed to the [Entities](https://remult.github.io/guide/setup-remult.html#entities) section of the tutorials
